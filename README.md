# Multiple-Choice-Button
An update on my previous quiz, but this one works on the raspberry pi with buttons

Added improvements include:

-Works with the Raspberry Pi
-Slightly better questions
-Added templates so you can add your own questions

Used some resources found here
www.makezine.com/projects/tutorial-raspberry-pi-gpio-pins-and-python/

Pretty proud of this since I got the buttons to work and added in some neat while loops, took a while to allow the button to be pressed once and move onto next question, so to combat this I made a variable called question and it changed everytime a button was pressed so it moved onto the next loop.
